This Python library takes care of many aspects of the [MPDS platform API](http://developer.mpds.io), such as pagination, error handling, validation, proper data extraction and more. We encourage our users to adopt this library for their needs. This library follows the [standardization guideline](https://github.com/hackingmaterials/matminer) on data mining for materials science from LBNL, Berkeley, USA. Please, see the [developer docs](http://developer.mpds.io).
